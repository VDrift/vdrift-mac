VDrift Mac OS X build dependencies.

README:

VDrift is a cross-platform, open source driving simulation made with drift racing in mind. The driving physics engine was recently re-written from scratch but was inspired and owes much to the Vamos physics engine. It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3. It is currently available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Documentation: http://wiki.vdrift.net/Main_Page
Source repositories: https://github.com/VDrift
Data repository: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vdrift/


HARDWARE:

VDrift requires a relatively fast CPU. A 2 GHz or better clock speed is recommended, although it should be possible to run VDrift with a 1 GHz or better CPU.
On a typical run, VDrift might consume 300 MiB of memory space. 512 MiB of memory may be sufficient on some operating systems. 1 GiB or more is recommended, and required for larger tracks.
VDrift requires a recent nVidia or ATI graphics card. A nVidia GeForce 7-series or better (or the equivalent ATI card) is recommended in order to enable all the visual effects. By reducing or disabling some of the display options, it should be possible to play VDrift with a nVidia GeForce 2 or better. Users should install the newest version of the device drivers for their graphics card to run VDrift. Intel graphics cards are not supported.


PREREQUISITES:

- The VDrift Mac OS X project requires Xcode 3.2 or later. The latest version, Xcode 4.1 is free on the Mac App Store.
- Get the VDrift source code, either from the latest source release on the VDrift downloads page, or the development version. You'll need the source code and the Mac OS X dependencies.
For downloading the source code from the repository execute the following in a terminal:
git clone https://github.com/VDrift/vdrift.git
cd vdrift
git clone https://github.com/VDrift/vdrift-mac.git

BUILDING:

Open tools/osx/vdrift.xcodeproj and in Xcode 4 or higher click "Build" in the "Product" menu, otherwise hit "Build" from XCode's "Build" menu.


ERROR FIXING:

If when building, you get some errors, it is most likely because the Xcode project is out of date (it often is as we don't have an active Mac OS X developer). To fix it:
- Remove files from Xcode that are in the project but not in the repository anymore.
- Add new files to Xcode that are in the repository, but have not yet been added to the project.


EXPERIMENTAL - PREMAKE:

To build VDrift with premake, you first need to download and install premake4. Then make sure you have downloaded the source code and the vdrift-mac dependancies package. In a terminal use the command:
premake4 xcode3
to generate an Xcode project which you can use to build VDrift, as before. For more options you can use
premake4 --help

IMPORTANT: To make the project build, you need to add "vdrift-mac/Frameworks" to Framework Search Paths in Build Settings.
