VDrift Mac OS X build dependencies.

VDrift - a car racing simulator for multiple platforms
======================================================

VDrift is a cross-platform, open source driving simulation made with drift
racing in mind. The driving physics engine was recently re-written from scratch
but was inspired and owes much to the Vamos physics engine. It is released under
the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3. It is currently available for Linux,
FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows.

Mission Statement
-----------------

The goals of the VDrift project are:

- to be a high-quality, open source racing simulation featuring enjoyable and
  challenging gameplay;
- to take advantage of modern computing hardware to accurately simulate vehicle
  physics in rich and immersive racing environments; and
- to provide a platform for creative experimentation to a community of
  developers and artists.

Hardware Requirements
=====================

CPU
---

VDrift requires a relatively fast CPU. A 2 GHz or better clock speed is
recommended, although it should be possible to run VDrift with a 1 GHz or better
CPU.

GPU
---

VDrift requires a recent nVidia or ATI graphics card. Some Intel graphics cards may work with recent drivers.

A nVidia GeForce 7-series or ATI Radeon X1000-Series card is recommended in
order to enable all the visual effects. By reducing or disabling some of the
display options, it should be possible to play VDrift with a nVidia GeForce 2 or
better.

HDD
---

VDrift takes up quite some harddisk space. The VDrift Data alone is about 1.6 GB
in size and you will need to check it out, first and install it afterwards. So
be prepared for handling some 3 - 5 GB.

RAM
---

VDrift consumes 300 MiB of memory space on a typical run. 512 MiB of
memory may be sufficient on some operating systems. 1 GiB or more is
recommended and required for larger tracks.

Downloading VDrift
==================

For downloading the source code from the repository execute

    git clone https://github.com/vdrift/vdrift.git

Downloading VDrift Data
-----------------------

VDrift Data is expected to reside in a folder called data in the root of VDrift,
so change your directory to the root of the sources:

    cd vdrift

Currently the VDrift Data is still hosted at Sourceforge, so to getting it
requires checking out the repository with subversion:

    svn checkout https://vdrift.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vdrift/vdrift-data data

Dependencies
============

Download the dependencies for Mac OS:

    cd vdrift
    git clone https://github.com/vdrift/vdrift-mac.git

Compiling VDrift
================

- The VDrift Mac OS X project requires Xcode 3.2 or later. The latest version, Xcode 4.2 is free on the Mac App Store.
- Open vdrift/vdrift-mac/vdrift.xcodeproj and in Xcode 4 or higher click "Build" in the "Product" menu, otherwise hit "Build" from XCode's "Build" menu.

Error Fixing
============

If when building, you get some errors, it is most likely because the Xcode project is out of date (it often is as we don't have an active Mac OS X developer). To fix it:
- Remove files from Xcode that are in the project but not in the repository anymore.
- Add new files to Xcode that are in the repository, but have not yet been added to the project.
